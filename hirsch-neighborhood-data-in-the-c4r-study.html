    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      This study looked at how where you live — your neighborhood — can affect your chances of getting sick from COVID-19. Scientists used data from over 50,000 people across the U.S. in the C4R study. They looked at things like how green an area is, how close people live to each other, how much pollution there is, and how rich or poor the area is. They found that people in different places had different chances of getting sick, and some areas were healthier than others. This helps us understand how our surroundings affect our health.

    <h4>1. How Your ZIP Code Could Predict Your COVID Risk</h4>
    <p>
      A groundbreaking study from the C4R project shows that our neighborhoods — from pollution levels to access to green space — played a big role in how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted communities. Researchers collected and catalogued neighborhood data from across the U.S. to explore why some areas were hit harder than others.

    <h4>2. Mapping COVID with a New Kind of Data</h4>
    <p>
      Beyond vaccines and hospital beds, what else shaped COVID-19's path? The answer might lie in the very streets we live on. The C4R team gathered information on neighborhood density, wealth, car use, air quality, and more — turning a map into a health tool for the future.
    </p>

    <h4>3. When the Environment Shapes the Outcome</h4>
    <p>
      Not all communities are equal — and that matters in a pandemic. The C4R study’s deep dive into neighborhood data reveals that local factors, like pollution and housing types, may influence COVID severity and recovery. A wake-up call for equitable public health planning.
