    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      When people get a COVID-19 vaccine, their body makes antibodies to protect them. This study looked at over 2,000 adults in the U.S. to find out who makes more or fewer antibodies after getting the vaccine. People who were older, men, or had diabetes or smoked had fewer antibodies. But people who had already been sick with COVID before getting the vaccine had more antibodies. This helps doctors understand who might need more protection in the future.

    <h4>1. Who Gets the Best Boost from COVID-19 Vaccines?</h4>
    <p>
      A new study from the C4R project shows that not everyone responds to COVID-19 vaccines the same way. Factors like age, gender, diabetes, and smoking can lead to weaker antibody responses. But having had COVID before vaccination can give your immune system a big boost. These findings could help guide booster shot strategies.
    </p>

    <h4>2. COVID-19 Vaccines Work — But Some People May Need More Help</h4>
    <p>
      Scientists studied antibody levels after vaccination and found that older adults and people with certain health issues may not have as strong a response. That doesn’t mean the vaccine doesn’t work — but it does mean we might want to offer extra support to those groups.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Natural Immunity + Vaccine = Stronger Protection?</h4>
    <p>
      If you had COVID-19 before you got your vaccine, your antibody levels may be higher. The C4R study shows that prior infection adds an extra layer to your immune response. This is more evidence that the immune system learns in powerful ways — and why boosters could be tailored in the future.

      <li><strong>Did you know?</strong> Older adults, men, and people with diabetes may have lower antibody responses to COVID vaccines. The C4R study says we should consider that when planning boosters. #VaccineScience</li>
      <li>If you had COVID before your shot, your body might make more antibodies! Prior infection could help boost vaccine response. #COVIDImmunity</li>
      <li>Not all immune systems respond equally to vaccines — but all responses still matter. C4R researchers are finding out who might benefit from extra support. #COVID19Research</li>

    <h4>Title: Who Gets the Strongest COVID-19 Vaccine Response?</h4>
    <p>
      [Opening shot: Host in a lab or home setup, upbeat background music]
      <br><strong>Host:</strong> "Did you know your body’s response to the COVID vaccine might depend on your age, gender, or even your health history? Let’s break down what scientists found."
      <br><br>
      [Cut to graphics of immune cells and antibodies labeled "spike protein"]
      <br><strong>Host (voiceover):</strong> "The C4R study looked at over 2,000 vaccinated adults and measured how many antibodies they produced. These antibodies help fight off the virus."
      <br><br>
      [On screen: Chart showing higher vs. lower antibody groups]
      <br><strong>Host:</strong> "People who were older, male, or had diabetes or smoked had fewer antibodies. That’s not great news — but it helps us understand who may need more help."
      <br><br>
      [Cut to split screen: Someone recovering from COVID, then getting vaccinated]
      <br><strong>Host:</strong> "Interestingly, folks who had COVID before they got vaccinated had more antibodies. That’s what scientists call ‘hybrid immunity.’"
      <br><br>
      [Closing call to action]
      <br><strong>Host:</strong> "So what does this mean for you? Talk to your doctor, stay updated on boosters, and remember — science helps us protect everyone, especially those who need it most."
