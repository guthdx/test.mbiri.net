    <h2>🌍 Community Summary</h2>
    <p>This study looked at nearly 50,000 people across the U.S. to understand how often COVID-19 led to serious illness, hospital stays, and death. Researchers created a system to carefully review hospital records to confirm if COVID-19 was truly the cause. They found that most hospitalizations marked as “COVID-19” were accurate, but sometimes people were in the hospital for other reasons and just happened to test positive. The study also showed that pneumonia and kidney problems were the most common complica...

    <h3>1. "Untangling COVID-19 Hospital Records"</h3>
    <p>Did everyone hospitalized with COVID-19 really need care for it? A new study says not always. Careful review showed that 7% of hospitalizations weren’t caused by COVID-19 itself. That’s why it’s so important to double-check medical records when studying the pandemic.</p>

    <h3>2. "What Complications Did COVID-19 Cause Most Often?"</h3>
    <p>Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 80% developed pneumonia and 34% had kidney problems. Other issues like blood clots and heart attacks were less common. Understanding these risks helps doctors prepare for future pandemics.</p>

    <h3>3. "Why Counting COVID-19 Cases Isn’t Simple"</h3>
    <p>This study shows that hospital codes aren’t always reliable. Doctors found that diagnosis codes missed many cases of complications like kidney failure or blood clots. Careful review is key for accuracy in health research.</p>

    🏥 Not every COVID-19 hospitalization was truly *for* COVID-19. About 7% were for other reasons, with patients testing positive on the side. Accuracy matters in pandemic research. #COVID19 #PublicHealth</p>

    <p><strong>Post 2:</strong><br>
    🫁 Pneumonia was the most common complication for hospitalized COVID-19 patients (80%), followed by kidney injury (34%). Doctors are learning what to watch for in future outbreaks. #HealthResearch</p>

    <p><strong>Post 3:</strong><br>
    🧾 Hospital codes don’t always tell the full story. This study found many missed cases of COVID-19 complications. Careful review is essential. #PandemicLessons</p>

    <h3>Title: "What Really Counts as a COVID-19 Hospitalization?"</h3>
    <p>[Opening slide: “COVID-19 Hospitalizations Under the Microscope”]</p>
    <p>During the pandemic, we often heard numbers about hospitalizations and deaths. But how accurate were they? A national study of nearly 50,000 adults dug into hospital records to find out.</p>
    <p>Researchers discovered that while most cases were truly due to COVID-19, about 7% were not. These patients tested positive but were in the hospital for other reasons. The most common true complications? Pneumonia in 80% of patients and kidney problems in 34%. Blood clots and strokes were less common.</p>
    <p>Another key finding: hospital coding systems weren’t always reliable. Some complications were missed if doctors only looked at codes instead of full medical records.</p>
    <p>This careful review system helps researchers understand COVID-19 more clearly — and will make us better prepared for the next health crisis.</p>

    <h2>🔎 Main Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>49,790 participants were tracked across 14 cohorts; 1,974 potential COVID-19 hospitalizations or deaths were identified.</li>
        <li>After review, 1,030 events were confirmed as COVID-19-related.</li>
        <li>77% of hospitalized cases were severe, 31% were critical.</li>
        <li>Pneumonia (80%) and kidney injury (34%) were the most common complications; clots, strokes, and heart attacks were much less frequent.</li>
        <li>7% of patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 but not because of it.</li>
        <li>Diagnosis codes often missed complications, making careful medical record review essential.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🏥 How This Information Can Be Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Providers:</strong> Be alert to common COVID-19 complications, especially pneumonia and kidney injury, when caring for hospitalized patients.</li>
        <li><strong>Communities:</strong> Understand that hospitalization numbers may not always tell the full story — clear communication is key during health crises.</li>
        <li><strong>Program Directors:</strong> Develop better data systems that go beyond codes to capture the real impact of diseases like COVID-19.</li>
        <li><strong>Legislators:</strong> Support policies that improve medical record access and review systems to strengthen pandemic response and accuracy.</li>
