                <p>
                    Some people think that Native American and Alaska Native women drink more during pregnancy than other women. But this study shows that isn't true for everyone. In fact, many Native women don't drink at all during pregnancy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The study looked at lots of research and found that most of it only talked to women who were already having problems with alcohol. That gives people the wrong idea about all Native women. Also, some old stories wrongly say Native people can't handle alcohol, which is not based on science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need better, fairer studies to help support women and their babies.

                <p>
                    There's a big myth that American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) women drink more during pregnancy than others. But this research shows that the truth is more complicated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The authors looked at 19 studies and found that most only focused on women already at high risk or in small areas. That means the results don't show what's happening across all Native communities. Some studies even accidentally made stereotypes worse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of blaming or labeling, we need better research that listens to Native women, works with their communities, and helps with real solutions.

                <h3>Blog Post 1: <em>Rethinking Stereotypes: Native Women and Alcohol During Pregnancy</em></h3>
                <p>
                    Stereotypes are powerful—and harmful. For years, data on alcohol use during pregnancy in Native communities have been misunderstood, misused, and misrepresented. A new study shows that these beliefs often come from poor research that focused only on high-risk groups. The truth? Most Native women do not drink during pregnancy. It's time to change the narrative—and use better data to support healthy futures.
                </p>

                <h3>Blog Post 2: <em>Why Better Research Matters for Native Mothers</em></h3>
                <p>
                    The way we study people can affect how we treat them. That's one of the biggest lessons from a review of research on alcohol use among American Indian and Alaska Native women during pregnancy. Most studies didn't reflect the full picture—they focused on women already struggling. We need fair, inclusive studies that listen to Native voices and help communities, not stereotype them.
                </p>

                <h3>Blog Post 3: <em>The 'Firewater Myth' and the Real Story of Native Women's Health</em></h3>
                <p>
                    A dangerous old idea suggests Native people are biologically more prone to alcohol problems. It's called the "firewater myth," and it's not backed by science. This myth has influenced research and policies in damaging ways. New studies show Native and White women have similar drinking patterns in pregnancy. We must bust myths and build better support systems based on truth, not bias.

                <h3>Title: "Truth vs. Myth: Native Women and Alcohol Use in Pregnancy"</h3>

                <h4>Intro – 0:00–0:30</h4>
                <p>🎙️ "Did you know that most studies about Native women and drinking during pregnancy might be misleading? Let's talk about what the science really says—and why it matters."</p>

                <h4>Segment 1 – 0:30–1:30</h4>
                <p>👩🏽‍🔬 A recent review looked at studies on alcohol use among American Indian and Alaska Native women. The researchers found that many studies only focused on women who were already at high risk—or from very small communities. That gave people the wrong idea.</p>
                <p>🧪 That kind of research doesn't show the whole picture. It ignores the many Native women who don't drink during pregnancy at all.</p>

                <h4>Segment 2 – 1:30–2:30</h4>
                <p>📜 This isn't just about statistics—it's also about history. There's an old, harmful belief called the "firewater myth" that says Native people are more biologically prone to alcohol addiction. That's false—but it still affects how people think and even how policies are made.</p>
                <p>📰 In one case, a single study from Alaska turned into a national headline that labeled a whole community unfairly.</p>

                <h4>Segment 3 – 2:30–4:00</h4>
                <p>💬 The truth? Drinking patterns among Native and White women are often <em>similar</em>. And most Native women reduce or stop drinking when they learn they're pregnant—just like most women do.</p>
                <p>👣 What we need now is better research—research that listens to Native women, includes diverse communities, and helps build real solutions.</p>

                <h4>Closing – 4:00–5:00</h4>
                <p>📢 "Let's stop repeating stereotypes and start supporting communities with accurate data and respect. Because every mom deserves care based on truth—not myths."</p>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>Most research on alcohol use during pregnancy in Native communities has been biased, focusing only on high-risk groups. This has led to harmful stereotypes. Native and White women show similar drinking patterns, and most Native women reduce or stop drinking when pregnant. Better, community-based research is needed to support maternal health.</p>
