    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      People who have healthy hearts may do better if they get COVID-19. This study looked at heart health scores from thousands of people using a tool called "Life’s Essential 8." It includes things like exercise, eating healthy, blood pressure, and sleep. The people with the best scores were much less likely to go to the hospital or die from COVID. This tells us that keeping your heart and body healthy could also protect you during a pandemic.

    <h4>1. Heart Health May Be Key to Surviving COVID-19</h4>
    <p>
      Could your cardiovascular health protect you from severe COVID? A new study says yes. Using the AHA’s Life’s Essential 8 scoring system, researchers found that people with the best heart health were 41% less likely to experience hospitalization or death from COVID-19. This is one more reason to take prevention seriously.
    </p>

    <h4>2. The Life’s Essential 8 and COVID-19 — What’s the Connection?</h4>
    <p>
      Life’s Essential 8 — a score developed by the American Heart Association — measures your heart health across eight areas, including diet, exercise, and blood sugar. A new study using the C4R dataset found that higher scores meant lower risk for severe COVID. It’s a powerful link between daily habits and pandemic outcomes.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Prevention Isn’t Just About Vaccines</h4>
    <p>
      Vaccines are essential — but they’re not the only line of defense. People in better overall cardiovascular shape had fewer severe COVID outcomes. This study suggests that improving your health now might protect you in the next crisis, too.
