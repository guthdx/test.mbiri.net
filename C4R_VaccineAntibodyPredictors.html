    <h2>🌍 Community Summary</h2>
    <p>This study asked: why do some people have stronger or weaker antibody responses after getting a COVID-19 vaccine? Researchers looked at nearly 6,800 adults from across the U.S. They found that people over 80, men, smokers, and those with diabetes or obesity often had weaker responses. People who had been infected with COVID-19 before vaccination, or who got the Moderna vaccine, tended to have stronger and longer-lasting antibody responses. Antibody levels were highest about 2 months after vaccina...

    <h3>1. "Why Some People Have Weaker COVID-19 Vaccine Responses"</h3>
    <p>A new U.S. study shows that age, sex, and health conditions affect how well COVID-19 vaccines work. Older adults, men, smokers, and people with diabetes often had lower antibody levels. But people with prior infection or who got Moderna’s vaccine had stronger responses.</p>

    <h3>2. "The Rise and Fall of Vaccine Antibodies"</h3>
    <p>Antibodies peak about 2 months after vaccination, then drop by about 23% each month. For some groups, like adults over 80, they decline even faster. This helps explain why boosters are so important, especially for high-risk groups.</p>

    <h3>3. "COVID-19 Vaccines: Not the Same for Everyone"</h3>
    <p>Vaccines save lives, but not all bodies respond the same way. This research highlights who may need extra doses or closer monitoring — and why personalized strategies matter in public health.</p>

    💉 Antibodies from COVID-19 vaccines don’t last forever. A big U.S. study shows they peak at 2 months, then fall by about 23% each month. #COVID19 #Vaccines</p>

    <p><strong>Post 2:</strong><br>
    🧬 Not all vaccine responses are equal. Older adults, men, smokers, and people with diabetes showed weaker antibody levels — but prior infection and Moderna shots helped. #PublicHealth #Prevention</p>

    <p><strong>Post 3:</strong><br>
    ⚠️ Boosters matter! This study found antibodies fade faster in adults 80+. Tailored strategies can better protect vulnerable groups. #COVID19 #HealthEquity</p>

    <h3>Title: "Why COVID-19 Vaccine Responses Differ"</h3>
    <p>[Opening Slide: “COVID-19 Vaccines & Antibodies”]</p>
    <p>Hi everyone! Did you know that not everyone responds to vaccines the same way? A national study of nearly 6,800 people found that antibody levels peak about 2 months after vaccination but then decline each month.</p>
    <p>Older adults, especially those over 80, men, smokers, and people with diabetes had weaker responses. On the other hand, people who had COVID-19 before getting vaccinated and those who got Moderna’s vaccine showed stronger antibody levels that lasted longer.</p>
    <p>So what does this mean? Vaccines are effective, but boosters and personalized strategies are key to protecting the most vulnerable among us. Public health leaders can use this data to plan smarter responses for the next pandemic.</p>
    <p>Thanks for watching, and remember: science helps us stay ahead of the curve.</p>

    <h2>🔎 Main Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Antibody levels peak 2 months after vaccination, then drop about 23% per month.</li>
        <li>Older age (especially 80+), male sex, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and only one vaccine dose were linked with weaker responses.</li>
        <li>People with prior COVID-19 infection and those who received Moderna had stronger, longer-lasting antibody levels.</li>
        <li>Differences in response suggest that vulnerable groups may need earlier or more frequent boosters.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="section">
    <h2>🏥 How This Information Can Be Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Providers:</strong> Identify patients at higher risk of weak vaccine response (older adults, men, smokers, diabetics) and prioritize them for boosters.</li>
        <li><strong>Communities:</strong> Share the message that not all vaccine responses are equal — encourage vulnerable groups to stay up to date on boosters.</li>
        <li><strong>Program Directors:</strong> Design vaccination campaigns that target high-risk populations with extra outreach and education.</li>
        <li><strong>Legislators:</strong> Fund research and booster programs to ensure vulnerable populations are protected, especially as immunity fades.</li>
