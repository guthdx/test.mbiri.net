    <h2>🌍 Community Summary</h2>
    <p>Heart disease is the number one cause of death for American Indian women. This study looked at whether having more children or problems during pregnancy (like high blood pressure or diabetes) made women more likely to get heart disease later in life.

Researchers followed over 1,200 American Indian women for about 13-16 years. They found that women who had five or more children or who had problems during pregnancy were a little more likely to get heart disease, but the results weren’t strong enough to prove for sure.

Even though it wasn’t a clear “yes,” the study shows these could be important warning signs. Doctors might want to watch women with many children or past pregnancy problems more closely for heart disease.</div>

    <h3>1. "Pregnancy and Heart Health: What American Indian Women Should Know"</h3>
    <p>A new study shows that pregnancy history can affect heart health later in life. American Indian women with five or more children or who had pregnancy complications may face a higher risk of heart disease. Routine checkups and prevention are key to protecting long-term health.</p>

    <h3>2. "When Pregnancy Complications Echo Later in Life"</h3>
    <p>High blood pressure, diabetes, or preeclampsia during pregnancy doesn’t just affect moms in the moment. These complications may raise the risk of heart disease years later. This study highlights the importance of long-term care for women’s heart health.</p>

    <h3>3. "Strong Heart Family Study: Lessons for Women’s Health"</h3>
    <p>Researchers found that among American Indian women, having many children or pregnancy complications may increase the risk of heart disease. But having two to four children seemed to lower risk. These findings can guide better prevention programs for women’s health.</p>

    <h3>Title: "Pregnancy and Heart Health: Lessons from the Strong Heart Study"</h3>
    <p>[Opening Slide: “Pregnancy, Complications, and Heart Health”]</p>
    <p>Hi everyone, today we’re exploring an important study of American Indian women and their heart health. Over 1,200 women were followed to see how pregnancy history affected heart disease risk.</p>
    <p>The key takeaway: women with 5 or more children or pregnancy complications, like high blood pressure or diabetes, were more likely to have heart disease later. Women with 2 to 4 children had the lowest risk. The findings weren’t conclusive, but they align with other research showing pregnancy health shapes ...
    <p>So, what can we learn? Pregnancy isn’t just about the short term — it can shape long-term health. This research can help communities, healthcare providers, and policymakers design better prevention programs for women’s health.</p>
    <p>Thanks for watching, and remember: strong beginnings lead to strong hearts.</p>

    <h2>🔎 Main Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Women with 5 or more children were more likely to develop heart disease than those with 0–1 child.</li>
        <li>Pregnancy complications like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, or high blood pressure were linked with higher risk of cardiovascular disease.</li>
        <li>Women with 2–4 children had the lowest risk of heart disease.</li>
        <li>While results weren’t statistically significant, they match past studies and suggest important long-term impacts of pregnancy health.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="section">
    <h2>🏥 How This Information Can Be Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Providers:</strong> Screen women with many pregnancies or pregnancy complications for heart disease earlier and more often.</li>
        <li><strong>Communities:</strong> Raise awareness that pregnancy health affects lifelong wellness and encourage regular checkups.</li>
        <li><strong>Program Directors:</strong> Design women’s health programs that include heart disease prevention for those with complicated pregnancies.</li>
        <li><strong>Legislators:</strong> Support funding for maternal health and cardiovascular screening programs in American Indian communities.</li>
