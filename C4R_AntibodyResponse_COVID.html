    <h2>🌍 Community Summary</h2>
    <p>This study looked at how people’s bodies made antibodies after a COVID-19 infection. Researchers studied more than 2,100 adults from across the U.S. They found that about half of people had antibodies to the virus within 6 months of being sick, but those antibodies faded after a year. Older people, men, people with lower incomes, and former smokers were more likely to have stronger antibody responses. Hispanic people and those who got vaccinated (even after infection) were less likely to show a...

    <h3>1. "Do COVID-19 Antibodies Last?"</h3>
    <p>Antibodies from a natural COVID-19 infection don’t last forever. A new study shows that only 37% of people still had antibodies a year later. This matters for how we understand immunity and long-term health.</p>

    <h3>2. "Who Builds Stronger COVID-19 Antibodies?"</h3>
    <p>Not everyone’s body reacts the same way to COVID-19. Older adults, men, and former smokers showed stronger antibody responses. But being vaccinated or Hispanic was linked with fewer antibodies. Scientists say these findings help explain why people experience COVID differently.</p>

    <h3>3. "COVID-19 and the Antibody Puzzle"</h3>
    <p>Antibodies are a key sign of how the body fights infection. This study found that many people lose them within months, especially if vaccinated or with mild illness. It shows why vaccines and continued health monitoring are so important.</p>

    🧬 COVID-19 infection doesn’t guarantee lasting antibodies. A new study found that only 37% of people had them a year after infection. #COVID19 #Immunity</p>

    🧪 Did you know? Age, sex, income, and smoking history all affect how your body makes COVID antibodies. Scientists are uncovering why some people fight off the virus better than others. #HealthResearch #C4RStudy</p>

    💉 Even after infection, vaccination was linked with fewer nucleocapsid antibodies. This shows how complex our immune response really is. #COVID19 #PublicHealth</p>

    <h3>Title: "COVID-19 Antibodies: What We’ve Learned"</h3>
    <p>[Opening Slide: “COVID-19 Antibodies & Infection”]</p>
    <p>Hi everyone! Today we’re talking about antibodies — the tiny defenders your body makes after a COVID-19 infection. A big U.S. study with over 2,100 people found that these antibodies peak around 6 months after infection, but by a year, most people lose them.</p>
    <p>Older adults, men, and former smokers had stronger antibody responses. But people who got vaccinated, even after infection, showed fewer of these antibodies. Hispanic participants also had lower antibody reactivity. Surprisingly, common health conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure didn’t make a big difference.</p>
    <p>So what does this mean? Antibodies fade, and not everyone makes the same amount. This matters for long-COVID research, future vaccines, and public health planning.</p>
    <p>Stay tuned for more — and remember, science helps us prepare for the next challenge.</p>

    <h2>🔎 Main Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Antibodies from natural COVID-19 infection peaked at 6 months but dropped to 37% after 12 months.</li>
        <li>Older age, male sex, lower income, and former smoking were linked to stronger antibody responses.</li>
        <li>Vaccination, Hispanic ethnicity, and milder infections were linked with fewer antibodies.</li>
        <li>Chronic conditions like diabetes or heart disease were not major factors.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="section">
    <h2>🏥 How This Information Can Be Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Providers:</strong> Understand that antibody levels fade and vary, so vaccination and monitoring are critical.</li>
        <li><strong>Communities:</strong> Share awareness that natural infection doesn’t always mean lasting immunity.</li>
        <li><strong>Program Directors:</strong> Plan resources for long-COVID research and antibody testing programs.</li>
        <li><strong>Legislators:</strong> Support funding for continued COVID-19 surveillance and studies of immune responses in diverse populations.</li>
