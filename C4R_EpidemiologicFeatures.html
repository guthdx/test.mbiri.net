    <h2>🌍 Community Summary</h2>
    <p>This study looked at how COVID-19 affected more than 54,000 people across the U.S. in 14 different community-based health studies. About 21% reported having COVID-19 by spring 2022. Vaccination rates were high (87%), but only about half of people had gotten a booster. Older adults, people with more education, and those with chronic conditions were more likely to be vaccinated. People with obesity or lower income were less likely to be vaccinated. Most infections (78%) were mild, but 3% led to hospi...

    <h3>1. "What We Learned from 54,000 People About COVID-19"</h3>
    <p>A massive U.S. study of diverse communities found that 1 in 5 people reported a COVID-19 infection by spring 2022. Vaccination rates were high overall, but boosters lagged behind. This research shows how different groups experienced the pandemic in different ways.</p>

    <h3>2. "COVID-19 in Real Communities: The C4R Study"</h3>
    <p>Unlike studies focused only on hospitals, the C4R study followed people living in communities across the U.S. It revealed differences in who got sick, who got vaccinated, and how severe infections were. These findings highlight the importance of community-based research.</p>

    <h3>3. "Why Boosters Matter: Lessons from C4R"</h3>
    <p>Even though 87% of people got vaccinated, only about half got a booster. Many infections were mild, but severe cases still happened. This shows why boosters are a key tool for preventing serious illness.</p>

    📊 By spring 2022, 1 in 5 adults in this major U.S. study had COVID-19. Vaccination rates were high, but boosters lagged. #COVID19 #C4RStudy</p>

    💉 87% of people got vaccinated, but only half boosted. Severe infections still happened, reminding us boosters matter. #PublicHealth</p>

    🌍 This community study shows who was more likely to get vaccinated and how infections played out differently across groups. Knowledge = power. #HealthEquity</p>

    <h3>Title: "COVID-19 in Communities: What the C4R Study Found"</h3>
    <p>[Opening slide: “Epidemiology of COVID-19 in Real Communities”]</p>
    <p>The C4R study followed more than 54,000 people in 14 different community-based studies across the U.S. to see how COVID-19 spread and who was most affected.</p>
    <p>By spring 2022, about 21% reported having had COVID-19. Vaccination was common, with 87% of participants vaccinated, but only about half received boosters. People with more education, older age, and chronic conditions were more likely to be vaccinated. People with obesity and lower income were less likely to be vaccinated.</p>
    <p>Most infections were mild, but 3% led to hospitalization and 1% to ICU admission. This shows the pandemic wasn’t experienced the same way by everyone — community factors mattered.</p>
    <p>These findings remind us that public health strategies must be tailored to different communities. Boosters, education, and outreach are key tools for prevention.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>54,340 participants from 14 community-based cohorts were included in the study.</li>

        <li>87% reported being vaccinated, but only 50% received a booster dose.</li>
        <li>Older age, higher education, and chronic conditions were linked with higher vaccination rates.</li>
        <li>Obesity and lower income were linked with lower vaccination rates.</li>
        <li>78% of infections were mild, 3% required hospitalization, and 1% required ICU care.</li>

    <h2>🏥 How This Information Can Be Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Providers:</strong> Stress the importance of boosters for patients, especially those at high risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Communities:</strong> Share education on how vaccines protect against severe disease, even if mild cases are common.</li>
        <li><strong>Program Directors:</strong> Focus outreach on groups with lower vaccination rates, like those with obesity or lower income.</li>
        <li><strong>Legislators:</strong> Fund programs to improve vaccine access and education in underserved areas.</li>
