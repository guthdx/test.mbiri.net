                <h2>📚 Summary</h2>
                <p>This study looked at how well people could breathe before the COVID-19 pandemic and how that affected their chances of getting very sick from the virus. Doctors used a test called spirometry to measure how well people's lungs worked. They found that people with more serious lung problems, like trouble blowing air out or breathing in deeply, were more likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID-19. This was true even for people who didn't have other big health problems. The researchers say we should help protect people with poor lung function more during things like pandemics.</p>

                <h3>1. Breathing Easy? Why Lung Health Before COVID Mattered</h3>
                <p>What if how well you could breathe years ago could predict how you'd do in a pandemic? A new study shows just that: people with poor lung function measured before COVID-19 hit were more likely to suffer severe illness. Even folks without known lung or heart conditions were at higher risk if their spirometry tests weren't great. It's a wake-up call to take respiratory health seriously, even before symptoms appear.</p>
                <h3>2. A Hidden Risk Factor: Poor Lung Function and COVID</h3>
                <p>Many people didn't know they had breathing issues until it was too late. This research from the C4R study reveals that undiagnosed lung conditions—especially lung restriction and severe obstruction—were tied to worse COVID-19 outcomes. It's a reminder that preventive testing like spirometry could be life-saving.</p>
                <h3>3. Not Just Smokers: COVID Risks and Lung Health for All</h3>
                <p>You might think only smokers or people with diagnosed lung disease had a tough time with COVID-19. Think again. This large study found that even people who seemed healthy—but had silent breathing issues—were more likely to get very sick. Investing in lung health matters more than ever.</p>

                    <li>Even if you don't smoke or have known breathing issues, your lung function still matters. Poor spirometry results = higher risk of serious COVID-19. #PreventionMatters</li>

                <p>[Cut to infographic: Spirometry measures FEV1, FVC, lung restriction, obstruction]<br><strong>Host (voiceover):</strong> "Researchers looked at nearly 29,000 adults across the U.S. using past spirometry data—basically, tests of how much air you can breathe in and out."</p>
                <p>[On screen: "Lung restriction" and "severe obstruction"]<br><strong>Host:</strong> "They found that people with serious lung issues—even those who didn't know it—were much more likely to end up hospitalized with COVID-19."</p>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>Pre-pandemic spirometry data from nearly 29,000 adults revealed that poor lung function—including lung restriction and severe obstruction—significantly increased the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death. Even individuals without diagnosed respiratory conditions faced elevated risk, highlighting the importance of lung function screening for pandemic preparedness.</p>
