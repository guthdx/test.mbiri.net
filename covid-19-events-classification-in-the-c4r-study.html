                <h2>📚 Summary</h2>
                <p>When someone goes to the hospital with COVID-19 or dies from it, scientists need to make sure it really happened because of the virus. This study created a system to check hospital records and make sure the right cases were counted. They looked at over 1,000 records and found that pneumonia was the most common problem. The system they used worked very well and helped give a clearer picture of how serious COVID-19 was for many people in the U.S.</p>

                <h3>1. How C4R Verified COVID Hospitalizations Across the Nation</h3>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges during the pandemic was knowing who was hospitalized *because* of COVID-19 — and not just with it. The C4R study tackled this by reviewing thousands of medical records with a special process to make sure the data was accurate. They found that pneumonia was the most frequent complication, and their methods may shape future public health tracking.</p>
                <h3>2. Building Better Data: C4R's COVID-19 Classification Effort</h3>
                <p>The C4R team knew that getting COVID data right meant more than just collecting discharge codes. Their protocol included physician reviews and objective standards for conditions like pneumonia, heart problems, and kidney injury. This makes their COVID data especially valuable for research on long COVID and health equity.</p>
                <h3>3. Why Counting COVID Events Isn't So Simple</h3>
                <p>What counts as a COVID hospitalization? Not all hospital stays are alike — and early in the pandemic, record-keeping varied widely. That's why the C4R study developed a detailed method for reviewing records. With over 1,000 confirmed cases reviewed, they're giving researchers one of the clearest pictures yet.</p>
