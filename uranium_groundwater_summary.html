Scientists tested water from 140 wells and found that about 5% of them had unsafe levels of uranium. But here's the good news: by studying how uranium moves underground, we can better predict where it's safe to drink. And for the Pine Ridge Reservation, that means clearer paths to safer water.</p><h3>Uranium's Underground Journey</h3><p>Did you know that uranium can act like a traveler in water? In some parts of South Dakota, uranium dissolves into groundwater and moves, especially in areas with more oxygen. But in places with no oxygen, it often gets stuck and stays out of the water. By tracing uranium's "fingerprint," scientists are learning where it goes and how to stop it from spreading. This is important for families who use private wells every day.</p><h3>Protecting Water on Tribal Lands</h3><p>Groundwater is life! Especially for communities that rely on private wells. On the Pine Ridge Reservation, a team of researchers worked with local partners to track uranium in the water. They used science and community input to map where uranium is likely to be high or low. This research is helping tribes make decisions about water testing, filtration, and long-term protection of their most vital resource: clean water.</p></div><div class="summary-section"><h2>📘 Facebook Posts</h2><ul><li>💧 Did you know that some wells in South Dakota have uranium levels above the safe limit?

What South Dakota Communities Need to Know"</h3><h4>Opening – 0:00–0:30</h4><p>[Footage of the Pine Ridge landscape, families using wells, local community life.]<br>Voiceover: "In the heart of South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation, many families rely on private wells for drinking water. But hidden underground is something you can't see... uranium."</p><h4>Scene 2 – 0:30–1:30</h4><p>[Footage of water samples, maps, lab testing.]<br>Voiceover: "A team of scientists tested 140 wells across the region. They found that uranium levels varied a lot. In some wells, it was above the safety limit. In others, it was safe. Why? It depends on what's happening underground."</p><h4>Scene 3 – 1:30–2:30</h4><p>[Animations or diagrams showing oxygen-rich vs. oxygen-poor zones.]<br>Voiceover: "Where there's more oxygen in the water, uranium dissolves and flows, ending up in your tap. But where there's no oxygen, uranium often gets stuck and settles out. Scientists call this redox chemistry, but you can think of it like rust vs. stone."</p><h4>Scene 4 – 2:30–3:30</h4><p>[Footage of communities, tribal meetings, well testing.]<br>Voiceover: "By using uranium's chemical 'fingerprint,' the team identified high-risk zones. This helps tribal leaders make smart choices about testing, treatment, and safe water access."</p><h4>Closing – 3:30–End</h4><p>[Footage of safe water use, kids drinking water, community celebration.]<br>Voiceover: "Clean water is a right, and with science and community working together, it's a right we can protect. Learn more, share the story, and support safe water for all."</p></div><div class="info-box"><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><p>Scientists tested 140 private wells on the Pine Ridge Reservation and found that approximately 5% had uranium levels above the EPA safety limit. Uranium mobility varies by location: oxygen-rich groundwater in the northeast allows uranium to dissolve and spread, while oxygen-poor conditions in the southwest keep uranium immobilized. Isotope analysis revealed uranium's "fingerprint," helping identify high-risk zones and inform water protection strategies.</p></div><div class="highlight-box"><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Uranium's movement in groundwater is controlled by oxygen levels—a process called redox chemistry. In oxygen-rich zones, uranium becomes mobile and can contaminate drinking water. In oxygen-poor zones, it precipitates out and remains in the soil, keeping water safer. This research empowers tribal communities to target water testing and treatment efforts where they're needed most.</p></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="footer-content"><div class="footer-logos"><img src="mbiri_logo.png" alt="Missouri Breaks Industries Research, Inc." class="footer-logo"><img src="nhlbi_logo.png" alt="National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute" class="footer-logo"><img src="shs_heart_logo.png" alt="Strong Heart Study" class="footer-logo"></div><div class="footer-text"><strong>Missouri Breaks Industries Research, Inc.</strong>This research summary is provided by MBIRI as part of our commitment to creating opportunities for health in American Indian communities.<div class="footer-credit">Part of the Strong Heart Study and NHLBI research collaboration.</div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
