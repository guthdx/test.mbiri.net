    <h2>📚 Simple Summary (6th Grade Level)</h2>
    <p>The American Heart Association made a list of 8 healthy things to do, called “Life’s Essential 8,” to keep your heart strong. This includes eating healthy, exercising, not smoking, and keeping a healthy weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar. Sleep is also on the list, but this study didn’t include sleep data.</p>
    <p>Scientists studied over 2,000 American Indian adults for 20 years. They found that people who did more of these 8 healthy things had a much lower chance of getting heart problems. The more goals they met, the lower their risk of heart attacks, strokes, or heart failure.</p>
    <p>This means doing healthy things now can help protect your heart for many years!</p>
