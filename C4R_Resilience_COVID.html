    <h2>🌍 Community Summary</h2>
    <p>This study asked: how resilient were people during the COVID-19 pandemic? Resilience means being able to “bounce back” after hard times. Researchers surveyed over 31,000 adults from across the U.S. They found that about 75% of people felt they could recover quickly after stress. But resilience wasn’t the same for everyone. Black and Hispanic participants, people with higher income and education, and married people reported higher resilience. Lower resilience was more common among women, unemployed pe...

    <h3>1. "Bouncing Back in Hard Times"</h3>
    <p>Resilience is the power to recover after challenges — and during COVID-19, most Americans said they had it. A major study found that three out of four adults felt they could bounce back. But resilience wasn’t evenly spread. Women, unemployed people, and East Asian participants reported lower resilience. These findings show why support systems matter.</p>

    <h3>2. "Resilience: A Hidden Strength During the Pandemic"</h3>
    <p>Even in one of the hardest times in recent history, many people found ways to adapt. Black and Hispanic participants, people with higher education, and those who were married showed stronger resilience. Understanding what fuels resilience can help communities prepare for future crises.</p>

    <h3>3. "Who Felt Most Resilient During COVID-19?"</h3>
    <p>A study of over 31,000 adults found big differences in resilience across groups. Women and unemployed adults often felt less resilient, while people with higher income felt more. These results can guide programs that boost resilience where it’s most needed.</p>

    <h3>Title: "Resilience in the Face of COVID-19"</h3>
    <p>[Opening slide: “Resilience During COVID-19”]</p>
    <p>Hi everyone! Let’s talk about resilience — the ability to bounce back after hard times. A big study asked over 31,000 adults in the U.S. how resilient they felt during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>The results? About 75% said they could recover quickly after stress. But resilience wasn’t the same for everyone. Black and Hispanic participants, married adults, and people with higher education or income felt more resilient. On the other hand, women, unemployed people, and East Asian participants report...
    <p>What does this mean? Resilience matters. It affects how we handle crises like pandemics — and it shows us where more support is needed to help people bounce back. Programs that build community connection, reduce stress, and provide resources can make a difference.</p>
    <p>Thanks for watching — and remember, resilience is a strength we can build together.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>31,850 adults across 14 cohorts were surveyed.</li>
        <li>About 75% reported high resilience during COVID-19.</li>
        <li>Higher resilience: Black and Hispanic participants, higher income and education, married adults.</li>
        <li>Lower resilience: women, unemployed people, and East Asian participants.</li>
        <li>Resilience differences highlight inequities in how people experienced the pandemic.</li>

    <h2>🏥 How This Information Can Be Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Providers:</strong> Screen for stress and resilience, especially in women and unemployed patients, and connect them to resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Communities:</strong> Create support programs that build resilience, such as peer groups or stress-reduction workshops.</li>
        <li><strong>Program Directors:</strong> Target resilience-building programs toward groups with lower self-reported resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Legislators:</strong> Fund mental health and community support programs, especially for vulnerable populations highlighted by this study.</li>
