    <h2>🌍 Community Summary</h2>
    <p>This summary comes from the Strong Heart Family Study, which followed more than 2,100 American Indian adults. Researchers wanted to see if meeting the American Heart Association’s “Life’s Essential 8” goals could prevent heart disease. These goals include eating healthy, being active, avoiding nicotine, getting good sleep, and keeping a healthy weight, cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar.

    <h3>1. "Healthier Habits, Healthier Hearts"</h3>
    <p>A new study of American Indian communities shows that better scores on the AHA’s Life’s Essential 8 lead to much lower risk of heart disease. People with the highest scores had a 75% lower risk compared to those with the lowest scores.</p>

    <h3>2. "The Power of Prevention: Life’s Essential 8"</h3>
    <p>Heart disease is a leading cause of illness and death, but prevention works. Following healthy habits like staying active, eating well, and not smoking reduced heart disease risk by nearly half to three-quarters in this study.</p>

    <h3>3. "Strong Heart Family Study: A Path to Better Health"</h3>
    <p>This 20-year study proves that the AHA’s Life’s Essential 8 isn’t just theory — it’s a roadmap to stronger hearts. American Indians with better scores had far fewer cases of heart attacks and strokes.</p>

    <h3>Title: "Life’s Essential 8 and Heart Disease in American Indian Communities"</h3>
    <p>[Opening slide: “Life’s Essential 8 and Heart Health”]</p>
    <p>Hi everyone! Let’s talk about heart health and prevention. A new study from the Strong Heart Family Study followed over 2,100 American Indian adults to see if meeting the American Heart Association’s Life’s Essential 8 goals could prevent heart disease.</p>
    <p>The answer is yes. People with moderate scores were 48% less likely to develop heart disease compared to those with low scores. People with the highest scores had 75% lower risk. That means stronger habits make stronger hearts.</p>
    <p>What are Life’s Essential 8? They include eating healthy, being active, avoiding nicotine, sleeping well, and keeping a healthy weight, blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure. Sleep wasn’t measured in this study, but the other 7 still showed powerful results.</p>
    <p>The takeaway? Prevention matters. Communities that support healthy habits can cut down on heart disease for future generations.</p>
    <p>Thanks for watching — remember, healthy choices today protect our hearts tomorrow.</p>

    <h2>🔎 Main Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2,139 American Indian adults without heart disease at baseline were followed through 2021.</li>
        <li>274 new cases of heart disease were identified (heart attack, heart vessel disease, heart failure, or stroke).</li>
        <li>Moderate scores (50–69) lowered risk by 48% compared to low scores (0–49).</li>
        <li>High scores (70–100) lowered risk by 75% compared to low scores.</li>
        <li>Life’s Essential 8 is a strong predictor of heart disease risk in American Indian communities.</li>
