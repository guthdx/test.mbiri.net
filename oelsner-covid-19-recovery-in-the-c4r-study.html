    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      When people get COVID-19, some get better quickly, and others stay sick for a long time. This study looked at almost 5,000 people from across the U.S. and found that about 1 out of every 5 people still weren’t fully better even 3 months after getting sick. People who were women or had extra weight were more likely to take longer to recover. Getting vaccinated and catching COVID during the time when Omicron was common helped people get better faster. This study helps doctors learn who needs more help to feel better after COVID.

    <h4>1. One in Five Still Not Recovered 3 Months After COVID</h4>
    <p>
      A major U.S. study shows that 23% of adults with COVID-19 hadn’t fully recovered after 90 days. Recovery time varied widely — and was often slower for women and those with obesity. The study also found that vaccination and infection during the Omicron wave led to faster recoveries. These insights help researchers and health providers better support those with lingering symptoms.

    <h4>2. Long COVID: Who Takes the Longest to Get Better?</h4>
    <p>
      According to the C4R study, not everyone bounces back from COVID-19 the same way. Women, people with obesity, and those who had more severe symptoms had a harder time recovering. In contrast, those who were vaccinated or infected during later waves of the virus, like Omicron, had better outcomes.

    <h4>3. Recovery Isn’t Just About the Virus — It’s About You</h4>
    <p>
      This large, national study found that personal health and timing mattered for COVID-19 recovery. Pre-existing health, vaccination status, and the variant you got all played a role. The lesson? Personalized care could be key in helping long COVID patients.
