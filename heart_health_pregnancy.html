    <h2>📚 Simple Summary (6th Grade Level)</h2>
    <p>Heart disease is the number one cause of death for American Indian women. This study looked at whether having more children or problems during pregnancy (like high blood pressure or diabetes) made women more likely to get heart disease later in life.</p>
    <p>Researchers followed over 1,200 American Indian women for about 13–16 years. They found that women who had <strong>five or more children</strong> or who had <strong>problems during pregnancy</strong> were <strong>a little more likely</strong> to get heart disease—but the results weren’t strong enough to prove for sure.</p>
    <p>Even though it wasn’t a clear “yes,” the study shows these could be <strong>important warning signs</strong>. Doctors might want to watch women with many children or past pregnancy problems more closely for heart disease.</p>

    <h3>"Can Pregnancy History Predict Heart Disease? What We Learned from Native Women’s Health"</h3>
    <p><strong>[Opening Scene]</strong> Gentle background music and visuals of Native families and communities.<br>
    <strong>Narrator:</strong> “When we think about heart disease, we often think about smoking, diet, or exercise. But what if something from decades ago—like your pregnancy—also played a role?”</p>

    <p><strong>[Visuals]</strong> Timeline of the Strong Heart Study and a woman completing a health survey.<br>
    <strong>Narrator:</strong> “Over 1,200 American Indian women were followed for more than 13 years. This was part of the Strong Heart Family Study.”</p>

    <p><strong>[Key Terms Displayed]</strong><br>
    - Grand multiparity = 5+ children<br>
    - Pregnancy complications = high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, seizures during pregnancy</p>

    <p><strong>Narrator:</strong> “The study looked to see if these women were more likely to get heart problems like heart attacks or strokes.”</p>

    <p><strong>[Bar Chart]</strong> 9.4% of participants developed cardiovascular disease.<br>
    <strong>Narrator:</strong> “Those with more children or complications had <em>somewhat</em> higher risk, but not a proven link.”</p>

    <p><strong>[Closing Message]</strong><br>
    “Even though it wasn’t statistically confirmed, this could still help doctors and women pay attention to early signs. Reproductive history matters when thinking about heart health.”</p>

    <p><strong>Call to Action:</strong> “Talk to your healthcare provider about your full history—including your pregnancies. It could help save your heart.”</p>
