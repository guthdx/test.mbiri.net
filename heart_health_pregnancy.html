While the association between having five or more children or pregnancy complications and heart disease risk wasn't statistically definitive, the findings suggest these factors may serve as important warning signs for future cardiovascular health.</p></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="footer-content"><div class="footer-logos"><img src="mbiri_logo.png" alt="Missouri Breaks Industries Research, Inc." class="footer-logo"><img src="nhlbi_logo.png" alt="National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute" class="footer-logo"><img src="shs_heart_logo.png" alt="Strong Heart Study" class="footer-logo"></div><div class="footer-text"><strong>Missouri Breaks Industries Research, Inc.</strong>This research summary is provided by MBIRI as part of our commitment to creating opportunities for health in American Indian communities.<div class="footer-credit">Part of the Strong Heart Study and NHLBI research collaboration.</div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
